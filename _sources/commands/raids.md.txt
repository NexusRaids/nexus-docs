   ``<1>``, ``<pokemon>``, "Use this to set the Raid Boss."

.. Note:: You can input the name of the flag followed by its value (flag:value), you can either separate flags with a space or with quotes ("flag: value" flag:value), and for flags that are either true or false, by just mentioning the flag the true value will be assumed ("weather-boosted" instead of "weather-boosted:true").

   All flags have its corresponding command, and aliases can be used as well. You'll also skip the raid setup if you input at least one flag.

   You can input all the flags you want, but you can also just input the values in the following order (you don't need to input all of them): [weather-boosted] [invites-limit] [only-hosting] [minimum-level] [train] [rehost]
