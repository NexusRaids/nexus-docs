.. Note:: Arguments on commands are separated by a space. Generally, when an argument is the last argument on a command, even if you separate text by a space it will all default to that same argument. If you wish to insert text that have a space into a single argument, you can wrap the argument in quotes ("argument"). For instance, if you want to award the raid master badge to the user called test user, this will work: ``!award badge "test user" "raid master"``
