> Once Nexus is added to your server, it will immediately create a new channel called `#nexus-updates`. This channel is used for update notifications and the `nexus-moderator` role for people who want to run administration commands.

## Configuring Nexus

### Raid Channel

> You need to setup your raid channel with `!server raid-channel <#channel>`. The raid channel is a special channel in which all raids will be.

### Cross-server Raid Channel

> You need to setup the channel in which you'll receive raids from other servers with `!server online-channel <#channel>`. You can send your raid to other servers by running `!go-live` inside a raid.

### Setup Your Mods

> Once Nexus is configured, add all your mods and admins to the `nexus-moderators` role.

### Setup Profiles

> Before a user can raid, a profile needs to be setup by running `!set profile` with entries that matches their Pok√©mon Go profile.
