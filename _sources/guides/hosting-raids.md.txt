# Hosting Raids

## Raid Command

> The `!raid` command in Nexus is the primary method for Host to create raids, and can only be used the "raid-channel" setup for the community. It can be used simply as `!r` or as a full meal deal. To learn more about the raid command please see <a class="reference internal" href="../commands/raids.html#raid">Raids Commands</a>.

## Screenshots

> In the "raid-channel", Trainers can simply upload a screenshot of the Raid Boss to create a raid, and Nexus will walk through the steps necessary to start the raid.

```eval_rst

.. Note:: Nexus has a 20 screenshot limit per month among all servers. Screenshots that are not able to be recognized do not count towards this limit. You will always be able to initiate a raid via the ``!raid`` command, even if you exceed the screenshot limit. Nexus will mention you in the "setup channel" if you run out of screenshots and react with a ðŸ›‘. If you would like to increase that limit please see :doc:`Donations<../donation>` to learn more.
