# Joining Raids

> In the "raid-channel" setup for the community, Trainers can join raids by clicking the "raid pass", and Nexus will prompt the Trainer to join the raid lobby. <a class="reference internal" href="#example-walk-through-steps">(See example below)</a>

## Raid Lobby Commands

```eval_rst

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Command", "Description"
   :widths: 20, 80

   ``!bye``, "Use this to leave a raid. If you are the Host the raid will end."
   ``!host``, "Use this in a raid to get information from the host."
   ``!ready``, "Use this to mark yourself as ready inside a raid."
   ``!time-left``, "Use this in a raid to see how much time is left on the raid."
   ``!unready``, "Use this to mark yourself as unready inside a raid."

.. Tip:: Nexus recognizes the word ``ready`` in the raid lobby so using ``!ready`` is optional.

```
