# Slash Commands

> Slash commands are the brand new magic from Discord. You can bring up all slash commands by typing `/`, and you can follow instructions, choose parameters and receive responses only you can see.

```eval_rst

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Command", "Description"
   :widths: 20, 80

   ``/raid <boss> <options>``, "The raid boss from your raid"
   ``/set country <country>``, "Set your country in your trainer profile."
   ``/set ign <ign>``, "Set your in-game name in your trainer profile."
   ``/set level <level>``, "Set your level in your trainer profile."
   ``/set code <trainer_code>``, "Set your code in your trainer profile."
   ``/set team <team>``, "Set your team in your trainer profile."

.. Note:: Existing servers will have to re-invite Nexus to allow these sort of commands to run (don't worry, this won't affect anything on your server other than giving more permissions to Nexus).
